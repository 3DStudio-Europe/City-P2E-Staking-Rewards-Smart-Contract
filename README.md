# City-P2E-Staking-Rewards-Smart-Contract
This repository contains a smart contract for a Play-to-Earn (P2E) system built on Ethereum. The contract allows users to stake ERC-20 tokens in whitelisted buildings, earn staking rewards, and claim building-specific rewards based on their ownership and the reward power of their buildings. The contract is designed with security in mind, featuring an owner-controlled configuration, security key protection for specific operations, and support for periodic reward claims. Ideal for blockchain-based games that integrate staking and reward mechanisms.

Key Features:

Staking: Users can stake tokens for predefined periods (30, 60, 90, 365 days) and earn rewards.
Building Rewards: Users can claim daily rewards based on the buildings they own and their reward power.
Security Key: Ensures that certain operations, like staking and proxy transfers, are protected and can only be initiated within the game.
Owner Control: Configuration settings such as reward percentages, staking buildings, and security keys are managed by the contract owner.
ERC-20 Token Compatible: Fully compatible with ERC-20 tokens.


Usage:

Stake Tokens: Users can stake tokens in whitelisted buildings and claim rewards after the staking period ends.
Claim Rewards: Daily building rewards can be claimed based on the user's inventory and the set reward frequency.
Contract Management: The owner can update settings, manage developer dividends, and reset the contract if needed.

This smart contract was designed by 3D Studio for 3D City: Metaverse
